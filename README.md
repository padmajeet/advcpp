App1 - Iterator pattern, It makes use of initializer list
       and auto varibale. It is implemented for the linked
       list and collection.

App2 - Iterator and collection interface, It can used between either an
       array, linked list etc.In this program it is extended for the
       myarray and mylinked list , this interface can be used for the
       other datastructure, so they must implement the collection and
       interator interfaces.It also explains about virtual function, how
       the vurtual function is treated and loaded when it is called.
